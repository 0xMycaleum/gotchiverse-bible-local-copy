## ðŸ“– Chapter 1: Gotchiverse Release Schedule
*Confirmed, but not immutable* 

The Gotchiverse is a cutting-edge piece of software that features real time gameplay across an open world, combined with onchain "play-to-earn" game mechanics, powered by the blockchain.

Our development team was originally shooting for a launch date of December 2021 for the first release of the Gotchiverse, but this proved to be overly-ambitious, as multiple issues were uncovered during the first Stress Test (ST1), held on December 20th.

These issues are mainly related to building out infrastructure capable of scaling the enormous Gotchiverse with thousands of players, Alchemica pickups, and parcels each taking up significant amounts of computing resources.

We are excited to announce that R&D on these fronts has proven fruitful, and our development team is confident in the following release schedule.

### Gotchiverse 2022 Release Schedule
#### Stress Test 2 - January 28th
A replica of Stress Test 1 (ST1) that should be much smoother, with less lag and fewer bugs. \
*Map size: Small test area*

Stress Test 3 - Mid-February
An initial test of "Area of Interest" scaling that breaks the map into smaller chunks for scaling. \
*Map size: One District*

#### Gotchiverse Land Auction / Raffle 3 - Late February
The third Aavegotchi Land Auction / Raffle combo will be held in late February and feature 10,000 Parcels up for grabs in various Districts.

#### Citaadel Live Test - Early-Mid March
The first release of the Citaadel with real Alchemica. Will support Alchemica pickups and "Save Points" to exit Alchemica from ingame to onchain. No Parcels or Installation equipping will be supported in this release. \
*Map size: One District*

#### Gotchi Lending is Live! - March
Audited and perfected, Gotchi Lending will be launched in March to allow us to scale up the number of players that can be online at any time.

#### The Gotchiverse - Late March / Early April
The Full Citaadel you've all been waiting for! Parcel access, installations, and harvesting will all be live in this release. \
*Map size: Entire Citaadel*

#### Traits Release - April
Aavegotchi traits (explained in an upcoming chapter) will be added to gameplay in this release.

#### Grid Release 1 - Early Q3 2022
